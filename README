About
-----

Marina.Rodeo is a GPL licensed SIP server implementation. It started as a fork of
Fokus Fraunhofer SIP Express Router (SER) project. Marina.Rodeo wants to be a more
open project, not only from license point of view, but more open as project
management, especially for external contributions.

Marina.Rodeo wants to overcome the development latency of current SER project,
to ensure a shorter path into a release for new added features.
Marina.Rodeo is a project maintained by Marina.Rodeo Solutions
           http://www.Marina.Rodeo-solutions.com/
by a team including core and main developers of SER project.
