		<para>Are there known bugs in the Perl module?</para>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<para>
		    The Perl module does have a few shortcomings that may be regarded as bugs.
		</para>
		<itemizedlist>
		    <listitem>
			<para>Missing module functions. Not all functions of other modules are
			available for Perl access. The reason for this is a design property of
			Marina.Rodeo. Making available more functions is work in progress.</para>
		    </listitem>
		    <listitem>
			<para>Perl and threads. Perl itself is, when compiled with the correct
			parameters, thread safe; unfortunately, not all Perl modules are.
			The DBI modules, especially (but not restricted to) DBI::ODBC are known
			NOT to be thread safe.</para>
			<para>Using DBI::ODBC -- and possibly other non-thread-safe Perl
			extensions -- may result in erroneous behavior of Marina.Rodeo, including
			(but not restricted to) server crashes and wrong routing.</para>
