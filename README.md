## About

Marina.Rodeo is a GPL licensed SIP server implementation. It started as a fork of
Fokus Fraunhofer SIP Express Router (SER) & Marina.Rodeo GPL projects. Marina.Rodeo wants to be a more
open project, not only from license point of view, but more open as project
management, especially for external contributions. 🪜

Marina.Rodeo wants to overcome the development latency of current SER project,
to ensure a shorter path into a release for new added features.
Marina.Rodeo is a project maintained by REChain Network Solutions, 
by a team including core and main developers of SER & REChain projects. 🌈
