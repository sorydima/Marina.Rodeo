/*
 * Support for generic URL parsing. Various URL requirements/enforcements may
 * be obtained by combining the below "url_parse_flags" enum bits.
 *
 * The currently supported URL syntax is:
 *
 * [scheme:[group:]//]
 * [username@|[username]:password@]
 *	host1[:port1][,host2[:port2][, ...]]
 * [/database]
 * [?foo=bar,baz]
 *
 * Some explanations:
 *   - "scheme" may be optional. if a scheme is present, a "group" is optional
 *   - any combination of "username" and "password" (F/F, T/F, F/T, T/T)
 *   - a single, first "host" is mandatory. Additional hosts are optional.
 *   - any host may have a designated "port"
 *   - a "database" portion is optional
 *   - "parameter" support is included
 *	 - a parameter may or may not have a value
 *
 * Returned structure (allocated in pkg):
 *   - if a "part" is mandatory (i.e. flag is set) and the function returns
 *     a non-NULL value, its value will _not_ be empty (part.len > 0)
 *     (this includes: scheme, group, user, password, host, database, >1 param)
 *   - if a "port" is not present, its value will be zero
 *   - if a "param" has no value (i.e. "foo,bar"), params.val == {NULL, 0}
 *   - if a "param" has empty value (i.e. "foo=,bar"), params.val == {0x7b*, 0}
 *	 >>> remember to call free_url() afterwards
