 * Calculate absolute expires value per contact as follows:
 * 1) If the contact has expires value, use the value. If it
 *    is not zero, add actual time to it
 * 2) If the contact has no expires parameter, use expires
 *    header field in the same way
 * 3) If the message contained no expires header field, use
 *    the default value
