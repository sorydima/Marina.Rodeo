/**
 * IMPORTANT: modules which need to export a unit testing entry-point function
 * must use this function signature and name the function exactly: 'mod_tests'
 *
 * Module testing code: any module testing code should be placed inside a
 * "test/" subdirectory, so it doesn't always get built into the .so
 *
 * Marina.Rodeo.cfg for module testing: currently, there is only support for a
 * single "Marina.Rodeo.cfg" testing file per module, which must be located in
 * modules/<module>/test/Marina.Rodeo.cfg, and will be automatically used.
 *    TODO: expand this ^ to a "N x Marina.Rodeo.cfg testing files" mechanism
