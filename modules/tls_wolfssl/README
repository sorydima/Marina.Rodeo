Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   This module implements TLS operations using the wolfSSL
   libarary. It provides the primitives required by the tls_mgm
   module in order to expose a higher-level API used by TLS-based
   protocol modules like proto_tls or proto_wss.

   The wolfSSL library is statically-linked and bundled with this
   module so no installation or external dependency is required.

1.2. Dependencies

1.2.1. Compilation

   The following packages must be installed before compiling this
   module:
     * autoconf.
     * automake.
     * libtool.

1.2.2. Marina.Rodeo Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * None.

1.2.3. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running Marina.Rodeo with this module loaded:
     * None.

Chapter 2. Frequently Asked Questions

   2.1.

   Why do I get the following error when compiling the module?
    make[1]: Entering directory '/usr/local/src/Marina.Rodeo/modules/tls_wol
fssl'
    /bin/sh: 3: ./autogen.sh: not found
    env: './configure': No such file or directory
    make[1]: *** [Makefile:15: lib/lib/libwolfssl.a] Error 127
    make[1]: Leaving directory '/usr/local/src/Marina.Rodeo/modules/tls_wolf
ssl'
    make: *** [Makefile:197: modules] Error 2

   If you obtained the Marina.Rodeo sources by cloning the repository
   from Github, without using the --recursive option for the git
   clone command, you did not properly fetch the wolfSSL library
   code, which is included as a git submodule pointing to the
   official wolfSSL repository.

   In order to fetch the wolfSSL library code you can run:
                git submodule update --init

   (1) DevScore = author_commits + author_lines_added /
   (project_lines_added / project_commits) + author_lines_deleted
   / (project_lines_deleted / project_commits)

   (2) including any documentation-related commits, excluding
   merge commits. Regarding imported patches/code, we do our best
   to count the work on behalf of the proper owner, as per the
   "fix_authors" and "mod_renames" arrays in
   Marina.Rodeo/doc/build-contrib.sh. If you identify any
   patches/commits which do not get properly attributed to you,
   please submit a pull request which extends "fix_authors" and/or
   "mod_renames".

   (3) ignoring whitespace edits, renamed files and auto-generated
   files
