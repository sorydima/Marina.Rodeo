/* This is a framework that allows the custom processes (requested by the
 * module) to use an I/O reactor for FD management. Beside re-usage, this also
 * helps with IPC support - this framework also comes (transparent for the
 * customer process) with IPC support - this will ensure a better integration
 * of this process into Marina.Rodeo, as the IPC will allow the access to 
 * load and pkg stats, will allow running scripting and proper shutdown.
