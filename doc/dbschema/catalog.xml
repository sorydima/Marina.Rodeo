    <!-- If xsltproc gets here while searching the catalog then no entry was
         found in the catalog files for the requested resource and in this case
	 xsltproc will attempt to download the resource from the internet using
	 the HTTP protocol. It will use the HTTP URIs from system identifiers
	 and URI references (therefore the XSL customization stylesheets in SER
	 refer to the original XSL stylesheets using HTTP URIs).

	 Note: Downloading DTDs and XSL stylesheets can be very slow, because
	       each file will be downloaded several times, because xsltproc
	       does not cache downloaded files.
